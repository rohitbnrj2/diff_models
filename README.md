# Classic Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model

The model built here is currently unconditional DDPM on CIFAR-10. Here, all the excess code of DDPM has been removed, this is a simpler implementation of the DDPM process.

Future Plans
1) Get results using cosine scheduler
2) Add EMA code to the model, improve sampling performance
3) Add conditional generation
